# Open source project from Lebanon

![image](https://github.com/HassanKanj/opensource-project-from-lebanon/blob/main/badge-400px.png)

Hello everyone,

My name is Hassan Kanj (حسن كنج), I am an independent programmer from Lebanon, and I would like to introduce you to the **open source project from Lebanon** initiative:

One of the ideas I had in mind for a while now, is that we need to work more as Lebanese developers on open source projects and to become more known in the international open source community and at the same time build some tools that can help us and other programmers (and not just build open source for the sake of open source), so I had an idea for a project, which is actually a badge that any open source repository from Lebanon can add to their README file.

This is just the beginning of an idea, that we can in the future build concepts, tutorials and documentation around it, like guides to help programmers from our country on how to build and contribute to open source projects, etc..

We can later have a single repository (or use this one) to list these projects as well, This repository contains the badge in order for Lebanese programmers to download and add to their open source repositories, with some instructions on how to do so.

If we communicated with other Lebanese developers who already have open source projects, and suggest they add this badge to their own repo, this will be a good start, and then we can proceed from there.

## Usage

In order to use this badge, make sure to [download it from here](https://github.com/HassanKanj/opensource-project-from-lebanon/blob/main/badge-400px.png), and then add it to your own repository.

You can show this badge in 2 different ways, and both are allowed (check [License](#license) for more details)

### 1- Showing the badge while linking back to this repository

In this method, whoever click the badge on your repository, they will be redirected to this one.

now let's assume you kept the badge name the same (i.e **badge-400px.png**), simply go to your **README.md** file and use this code:

`[![An open source project from Lebanon](https://github.com/[USERNAME]/[REPOSITORY_NAME]/blob/[BRANCH]/badge-400px.png)](https://github.com/HassanKanj/opensource-project-from-lebanon/)`

Make sure to replace:

**[USERNAME]** with your GitHub username

**[REPOSITORY_NAME]** with your GitHub repository name (the one that's in the url which doesn't contain spaces e.g **my-repository-name**)

**[BRANCH]** with your branch name (e.g **main**)

### 2- Showing the badge without linking back to this repository

In this method, whoever click the badge on your repository, they won't be redirected to this repository but rather to the image itself in your own repository.

now let's assume you kept the badge name the same (i.e **badge-400px.png**), simply go to your **README.md** file and use this code:

`![An open source project from Lebanon](https://github.com/[USERNAME]/[REPOSITORY_NAME]/blob/[BRANCH]/badge-400px.png)]`

Make sure to replace:

**[USERNAME]** with your GitHub username

**[REPOSITORY_NAME]** with your GitHub repository name (the one that's in the url which doesn't contain spaces e.g **my-repository-name**)

**[BRANCH]** with your branch name (e.g main)
